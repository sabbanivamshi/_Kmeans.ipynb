# Project Title
# Analysis and prediction of "Mall_customers" of american mall market called PHONIX MALL.To find out how many customers are visted to a particular shop.On the basics of prediction of Annual income vs Spending Score
# Problem Statement
# The American finance market as per the GDP of 2011"phonix_trillums"mall as in first range out 5.The owner of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop or products search in different types of clusters in entire mall.
# As a data science Engineer predict the futuristic financial for the upcoming gdp rate based on No.of Cluster.The client wants atleast 5 top clusters(shop).
# Project Approach

# Disclaimers
# In this particular dataset we assume annual income as centroid and spending score frome the range 1-100 called as datanodes of cluster.
####  REFFERENCES:-
# The model building algorithm devdelop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spot represents the "CENTROID" which is max of 3.
# According to the model basics prediction using machine learning algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster 1 is in red colour is highest cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes
